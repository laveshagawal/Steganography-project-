 Here are the steps:
### Step 1: Set Up the Environment
Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy pycryptodome
```
### Step 2: Create the Files
Create the following files in your project directory:
1. **sample_image_generator.py**: This file generates a sample image for testing.
2. **.gitignore**: Specifies which files to ignore in version control.
3. **main_steganography.py**: The main program for hiding and extracting messages.
4. **test_steganography.py**: The test script to verify the system.
You can create these files by copying the content from the previous full code sections.
### Step 3: Generate a Sample Image (Optional)
If you want a sample image to test with, run:
```bash
python sample_image_generator.py
```
This will create a file named `sample.png`.
### Step 4: Run the Main Program
To hide a message in an image:
```bash
python main_steganography.py
```
Then choose option 1 and follow the prompts.
To extract a message from an image:
```bash
python main_steganography.py
```
Then choose option 2 and provide the stego image and password.
### Step 5: Run the Tests
To run the test suite and verify the functionality:
```bash
python test_steganography.py
```
